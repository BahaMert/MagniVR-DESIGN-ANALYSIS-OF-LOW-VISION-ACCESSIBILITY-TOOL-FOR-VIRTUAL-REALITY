# Abstract
The field of Virtual Reality is a rapidly growing and increasingly popular medium,
however, the accessibility standards for individuals with low vision in VR have not yet been
fully established, leaving a significant gap in the provision of accessible VR experiences for
individuals with low vision. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness
and efficiency of accessibility tools for people with low vision in virtual reality by leveraging
the 3D modality of VR. Six volunteers participated in the study, three of whom had low
vision. The study utilised a virtual environment created in Unity, in which participants were
tasked with completing 9 tests in 3 or 4 different ways depending on their vision: once
without the use of any accessibility tools, and three more times using different accessibility
tools. The study used 3 different types of accessibility tools: a right-hand magnifier, a
left-hand magnifier, and a SeeingVR magnifier. The results of the study indicate that the
magnifier tools were a huge help for the participants with low vision in completing the tasks,
and reduced the cognitive load during the execution of the task. A comprehensive report is available
in the repository in the form of a PDF file.
